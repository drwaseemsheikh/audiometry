# audiometry

Audiometry is an open-source application framework based on WPF and .NET to create hearing test related applications. The framework is built using the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) software architectural pattern.

Audiometry can store, process, and visualize data corresponding to tuning fork tests including Weber, Rinne, Schwabach, absolute bone conduction, Teal, and Gelle; speech audiometry; pure-tone audiometry (PTA) including air conduction masked, air conduction unmasked, bone conduction masked, bone conduction unmasked, air conduction aided, loudness level, and sound field; impedance audiometry; bithermal caloric test; and advanced tests including alternate binaural loudness balance (ABLB), short increment sensitivity index (SISI), tone decay, and Stenger.

The application framework is extensible and can be used to develop new hearing test applications by extending the current functionality.

Audiometry is independent of specific hearing test hardware thus making it possible to be used with a wide variety of hearing test hardware.

Audiometry provides a unified and uniform interface for storing, processing, and visualizing data from a wide range of hearing tests that traditionally rely on different hardware and software to process and store data.
